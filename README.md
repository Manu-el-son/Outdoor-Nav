Effectively showcasing their campuses to potential students, parents, and visitors is a challenge that many universities and colleges have. Though interesting, traditional campus tours are constrained by scheduling issues, travel time, and tour guide availability. All interested parties may find it challenging to visit the school, especially those who are international students or have limited mobility due to these restrictions.

This project's goal is to create a web application for an augmented reality (AR) campus tour in order to address these issues. Through the use of augmented reality (AR), this web application will produce an engaging, dynamic, and educational virtual tour experience. The software attempts to offer comprehensive insights into buildings, departments, amenities, and historical sites by overlaying digital information over a virtual depiction of the campus.


This project's aim is to create an innovative web application that uses augmented reality (AR) technology to improve the conventional campus tour experience. With this project, we hope to develop a dynamic, immersive, and interactive platform that offers an insightful and captivating virtual tour of the campus to parents, visitors, and potential students.
The project intends to give people an accessible and entertaining method to tour the campus, independent of their actual location, by utilizing augmented reality technology. Through interactive maps, augmented reality markers, informative pop-ups, and multimedia content, the web app will provide comprehensive insights into campus buildings, departments, amenities, and historical sites.
